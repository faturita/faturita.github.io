* *Description*: StyleGAN2 is the implementation of a GAN network which is used to generate realitic fake faces.  The idea is to costumize this library to generate faces that are used by the Laboratorio del Sueño y Memoria.  This project is used by the laboratory to create behavioural memory experiments using these faces, in a way which is relevant to row witness convictions used in trial procedures around the world.  The goal is to gather evidence for review cases of wrongfully convicted persons.

* *Scope*: Implement the program that can generate the faces offline.
