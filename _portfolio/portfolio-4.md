excerpt: "ErrP Detection"

* *Description*: We replicated an amazing experiment performed by Itubarre (Millan and Cheverriaga team) on a differnt settings.  We wanted to verify if we could use ErrP signals to train a very basic gaming agent.  We verified that is possible, even with a very basic and straightforward faulty classificiation pipeline.

* *Scope*: The training of the agent was performed offline.  The next step is to perform it online.  Additionally, we want to verify other gaming strategies (the game is the simplest thing that we could found that triggered the ErrP signal)
