## Description 

This project aims to create a platform to perform experiments to study how to characterize a robot pet to achieve different reactions on kids, and to study how kids react to ECAs (Embodied Conversational Agent)s.

## Methodology

The first iteration we will create the platform that will allow us to perform the experiments.

##Â Scope

At the beginning is just the robot itself, based on Parrot Jumping Sumo.   Then we will try to use the robot to perform the first experiments.
