## Description

The idea is to create a phantom head for electrophysiology, which can be used first to generate artificial signals to feed electrodes and also to test the conductive properties of ballistic gel or a similar material (mimmicking human tissue).  This can also be used to test blind source separation algorithms.


## Details

Stage one involves creating the head from a mannequin, and the more complex part of instrumenting an electronical solution to generate very low power signals.
