## Description 


During several open-campus presentations we were surprised how kids reacted to small robots that can exhibit a set of behaviours. Kids, and particularly toddlers, instantly assumed the robot to be a pet, a living being, not different from a dog or cat. They assigned very quickly affective meaning to the robot behaviours and started to interact with it. For instance, some of the behaviours that we have identified were:

- Tapping and Shaking (Affirmative, Negative): When the robot shaked sideways tod- dlers instantly interpreted as negative response, and tapping (pitching, moving the nose down and up) was assumed as affirmative response.
- Twisting (joy): when the robot performed a 360 degrees twist, toddlers assumed that behaviour as joy.
- Moving around quickly (joy): when the robot moved around in semicircles back and forth, kids assumed that as an anxious happy response.
- Pushing forward on kidâ€™s feet (petting): kids interpreted the robot wanted petting all the time. A desire to look for being petted was inmediately understood from this behaviour.

Then the following question was posed: Is there a set of behaviours that are universally understood in a small robot-pet by kids that carry affective information?

This project aims to create a platform to perform experiments to study this question and how to characterize a robot-pet to achieve different reactions on kids, and concordently to study how kids react pet-robots and to ECAs (Embodied Conversational Agent)s.

## Methodology

The first iteration we will create the platform that will allow us to perform the experiments.

## Scope

At the beginning is just the robot itself, based on Parrot Jumping Sumo.   We will try to use the robot to perform the first set of experiments.
