## Decription 

This project is based on this <https://www.essex.ac.uk/research-projects/adaptive-joint-cognitive-systems> and aims to investigate how metacognitive information can be extracted from EEG signals, and how this information can be used to ease the communication between artificial intelligence agents and humans while making joint decisions.

## Scope

The idea is to replicate one of the experiments, where humans and agents make a decision on a pandemic scenario simulation.
