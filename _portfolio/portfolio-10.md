# Details 

This project aims to develop, iteratively, a robotic vest that can help post-stroke patients with remaining walking balance disorders to perform rehabilitation procedures to recover back balance in walking.  The idea is to put in the vest sensors and vibrotactile stimulator that give feedback to the patient and allows he/she to incorporate the feedback signal, which could help in the rehabilitation process.
