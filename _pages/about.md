*神経ロボット - Neurotronics*

Advancements in neuroscience and the inception of neuro wearable headsets are enabling to channel brain signals, or biosignal information, directly into smart mechatronical systems.  These signals are obtained from the body of the wearer, and this information can be used to provide a more effective control of our digital gadgets, or to incorporate more context awareness into our smart digital products.  This changes the paradigm, shift the focus, and by incorporating neuroscience inside the control loop, naturally humans stay at the center of the problem and the solution.  It becomes a neural mechatronic device for *Human Augmentation*: technologies that use every kind of tool to augment human capacities, adapted to each one of us, regardless of our own conditions.
