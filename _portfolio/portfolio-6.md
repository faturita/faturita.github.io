# Description

MIMIR is a software platform based on python and MNE, that allows and assist the Sleep Researcher on the localization and classification of neural components that are relevant in Sleep Research.

# Scope

The method based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradients can be used to detect different trascient signal components, like K-Complexes.  We implemented a method which ended up being too slow but that was very good at matching existing template components against candidates on an EEG Stream.  There is a lot of work ahead to be done.
