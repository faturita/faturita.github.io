## Description 

Development of a rehabilitation VEST based on vibrotactile biofeedback to aid in post-stroke neurorehabilitation procedures aimed to restore dynamic balance.

## Scope
Stage one involves only creating the VEST and test clinical hypothesis.  The second stage is to create a good forecaster of the falling situation.  The third stage involves reading EEG information to deterine the intention of movement directly from the EEG signals.

* *Technologies*: IoRT, IMU, EEG, BCI

## Details 

This project aims to develop, iteratively, a robotic vest that can help post-stroke patients with remaining walking balance disorders to perform rehabilitation procedures to recover back balance in walking.  The idea is to put in the vest sensors and vibrotactile stimulator that give feedback to the patient and allows he/she to incorporate the feedback signal, which could help in the rehabilitation process.
