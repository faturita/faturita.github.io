## Description


Deep fakes are everywhere and the next few years are going to be a big issue all around the world.  This is an arms race that requires to produce tools that are able to deal with the problem, to move the post ahead.  One way in which this can be done, is by using physiological valid or physically valid models derived from the videos, to see if the information that is obtained from the video is indeed valid or not.

For instance, physics require certain restrictions to be met in terms of possible masses, how they move, energy constraints and so on.  A video can be analyzed trying to understand if these constrainst are met and if not flag the video as false.  This is exactly what we do when we see a video and we apply our understanding of how things work in the world to see if what is happening in the video is real or not.

A similar situation can also be applied with deep fakes from people, where for instance, the respiration must be met, if the person is running or moving, there must be some change in the way the person breath and this can eventually be detected.

## Scope

Iterate the idea first, trying to achieve some minor goal related to this.  This is a long term project.
