## Description 

During several open-campus presentations we were surprised how kids react to robots, particularly to small robots that can exhibit a set of behaviours.  Kids, and particularly toddlers, reacted very quickly assuming the robot to be a pet, a living being, not different from a dog or cat.  They understood very quickly those behaviours and started to interact with the robot understanding what the robot **seemed** to want, or what was his behaviour about.  These behaviours were:
- Yes nodding, no shaking:  When the robot shaked sideways it was instantly interpreted as no, and shaking the head (tapping) was assumed as no.
- Twisting as joy:  when the robot twisted 180 degrees it was assumed as joy.
- Moving around quickly as joy:  when the robot moved around in circles back and forth.
- Petting: petting was very quickly undersand and the behaviour looking for petting. 

Then the following question was posed: Is there a set of behaviours that universally understood in a small robot pet by kids that carry affective information?

This project aims to create a platform to perform experiments to study this question and how to characterize a robot-pet to achieve different reactions on kids, and concordently to study how kids react pet-robots and to ECAs (Embodied Conversational Agent)s.

## Methodology

The first iteration we will create the platform that will allow us to perform the experiments.

## Scope

At the beginning is just the robot itself, based on Parrot Jumping Sumo.   Then we will try to use the robot to perform the first experiments.
