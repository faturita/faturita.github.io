* *Description*: This is a basic robotic prototype that can carry the oxygen tank of an enphisema patient.  It is designed to be used for Pulmonary Rehabilitation protocols that are performed in ALPI.  The robot works by following the tethers and adjust their velocity based on the length difference.  It uses the hardware, electronics, and software that we created as a IoRT platform.

* *Scope*: We just iterated once.  We need to keep going.  There is a lot of things to do ahead of us.
