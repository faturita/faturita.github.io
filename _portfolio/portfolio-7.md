* *Description*: any kind of BCI solution requires a capturing device, likely based on noninvasive EEG.  Hence the costs associated with the device should be reduced.  This projects is our own implementation of an EEG device based on DIY and Open Hardware, particulary OpenBCI.

* *Scope*: we 3D printed the UltraCortex headset but it is very unconfortable to wear. Additionally, cable movement induces a lot of noise in the signals.  The headset should be ergonomic and it must be able to wear at night while sleeping (for sleep research).
