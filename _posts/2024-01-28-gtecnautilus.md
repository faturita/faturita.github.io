Quick guidy and set up for g.Tec g.Nautilus Device.

# g.Tec Nautilus
Welcome to the g.Tec g.Nautilus Device.

The device is called g.Nautilus, and it is different from g.USBAmp.   The server is g.NeedAccessServer which handles the server driver (like NeuroSky) and handles incoming requests to the specified port.

## Parameters
* Butterworth 48-53 Hz para notch filter
* Butterworth 0.5 - 30 Hz filtro band pass
* Noise Reduction
* Sin CAR
* Unipolar


## Charging of g.Nautilus Research Headset
The g.Nautilus Research Headset is charged via an inductive charging technology according to the QI standard of the Wireless Power Consortium2. Position the Headset (switched on or off) onto a QI compatible charging pad. Charging starts automatically and is indicated via the permanently blue glowing status-LED (see Error! Reference source not found.). A blue blinking Status-LED indicates that the capacity has reached 70 % of its maximum. If the status-LED is flashing very quickly, the accumulator is fully charged. The accumulator cannot be overcharged, so the Headset can stay on the charging pad without being damaged.
Details for the correct maintenance of the accumulator:
The g.Nautilus Research Headset has a built-in Lithium-Ion accumulator. When the device is delivered, the accumulator is partly charged. Before first use, fully charge the device until the status-LED starts flashing. If the device is not used for more than 2 weeks, take care that the accumulator is always charged between 50 and 90 %. This will maximize the accumulator’s lifetime. So, before longer storage, the device should be charged until the status-LED blinks slowly. If the device is stored for more than 8 weeks, a risk of deep discharge of the accumulator exists, which could lead to damage! For this reason, the device must be charged every 4 weeks, or every 8 weeks at most, until the status-LED blinks slowly.
In case the device is not switched off after use, it will run until the voltage of the accumulator falls to a critical value and will switch off automatically. In this case, the device should be charged as soon as possible to prevent deeper discharge and damage of the accumulator.
The longest possible lifetime of a Lithium-Ion accumulator is achieved if it is charged to 100 % and then discharged to less than 20-30 % happens as rarely as possible. If feasible under the operational conditions, the accumulator should be charged if the status-LED color changes from turquoise to orange, and charging should be stopped when the status-LED starts to blink slowly. If the maximum operation time is required, continue charging till the status-LED shows flashes quickly.

#Cleaning of headset and electrodes
After usage, the Headset must be cleaned immediately to prevent the desiccation of gel. Use a flat bowl (about 10 cm deep) filled with warm water. A small amount of soap or shampoo may be used. Detach the device carefully from the cap, but leave the electrodes in the cap. Soak the cap with the electrodes for about 2 minutes in warm water. The device itself is splash water protected, but must not submerged into water! Clean all electrodes inside and outside with a soft toothbrush, ideally under water, until all gel is removed. Take care that the electrode leads are not damaged during cleaning! Do not use excessive force while cleaning. Finally, rinse the cap and all electrodes with clean, lukewarm water. Again, do not submerge the device in water, and do not expose it powerful streams of water such as some cleaning jets.
Put one towel inside the cap and one towel outside to remove the water. Then, put the cap in an appropriate place for drying. Avoid stretching the cap’s fabric during the process of drying. Please note that devices that blow warm or hot air, such as devices to dry hands or hair, must not be used to dry electrode caps. Careful treatment prolongs life time. Take care that all components are fully dry before storing or packing g.Nautilus Research!
After drying, the cap and the electrodes may be disinfected by submerging them into 70 % Isopropanol for 2 minutes. The device itself must be prevented from germicide.
