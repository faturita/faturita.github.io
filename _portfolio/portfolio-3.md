[Preprint of the first iteration](https://github.com/faturita/IEEEtran/blob/master/alpibot.pdf)

* *Description*: This is a basic robotic prototype that can carry the oxygen tank of an enphisema patient.  It is designed to be used for Pulmonary Rehabilitation protocols that are performed at ALPI.  The robot works by following a pair of tethers and adjust their velocity based on the their length difference.  It uses hardware, electronics, and software that we created as a IoRT platform.  Very cheap.

* *Scope*: We just iterated once.  We need to keep going.  There is a lot of things to do ahead of us.
