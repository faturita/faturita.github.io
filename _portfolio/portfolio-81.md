* *Description*: Online Banks are claiming for this.  They want to be able to identify that an actual person is behind a mobile phone and is trying to register into a mobile app, to get a banking account, to issue a mortgage and so on.  It is not exactly recognizing who the person is against some previous record based on the picture of the face.  It is understaing that the picture is not fake, and that the person is not wearing a mask.  It is a anti-spoofing approach. 

* *Project*: The idea of this project is first to implement a desktop application that uses the camera from the computer to perform liveness detection.  It is also interesting to use the mobile camera to do the same.  The final scope is to perform all that using only javascript in a web app and do that offline withtout the intervention of any server side component.

* *Scope*:  the first steps towards the MVP is to have an application running either in a desktop app or in a mobile phone.
