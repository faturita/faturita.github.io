*Neurotronics*

Advancements in neuroscience and the inception of neuro wearable headsets are allowing to incorporate brain signals, or biosignal information, directly into smart mechatronical systems.  These signals are obtained from the body of the wearer, and this information can be used to provide a more effective control of our digital gadgets, or to incorporate more context awareness into our smart digital products.  This changes the paradigm, shift the focus, and by incorporating neuroscience inside the control loop, naturally, we humans stay at the center of the problem.  It becomes a neural mechatronic device for real persons.
