* *Description*: Identification of KComplex for Sleep Research

* *Scope*: the method based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradients can be used to detect different trascient signal components, like K-Complexes.  We implemented a method which ended up being too slow but that was very good at matching existing template components against candidates on an EEG Stream.  There is a lot of work ahead to be done.
