## Description

KComplex are a very important neurophysiological marker with several implications in neurological diseases and sleep research.  It is a strong signal present during stages S2 and S3.  They are very important to identify and recognize and particularly to accurately identify all its component.

## Scope

Implement a method to effectively detect kcomplexes by their waveforms.
