## Description

This research track requires a better name, but it consist in the understanding and study of signals based on their representation as images, as bidimensional signals.  The generalization of signals to more dimensions is not well understood, and it entails a very rich area of study, particularly in terms of applications to solve existing problems.
For instance, one is the detection of Electroencephalography (EEG) Components using Scale Space Theory.

# Scope

There is still a lot to do.  One of the ideas is to use Scale Space methods, which are used in 2D images, to process directly the 1-dimensional signals.
