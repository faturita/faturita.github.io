## Decription 

This project aims to implement an EMG decoder for a very special ALPI patient using NeuroSky. This device is very easy to use, and very quickly it can obtain a valid signal from the forehead.   

## Scope

It is important first to implement a adaptive protocol system that can be adapted quickly to any person.  Once the communication protocol is established, the system must implement a basic communication protocol.  The idea is to complete the code to decode the signals, and once that is completed, put everything into a usable software package.
